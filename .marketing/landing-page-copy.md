## PROBLEM SECTION

**Section Headline:**
The setup tax no one warns you about

**Body Copy:**
You know exactly what you want to build. You can see your app working. You're ready to ship.

Then you sit down to code and spend the next three days wrestling with authentication flows you've set up five times before. Another four hours debugging Stripe webhooks that worked perfectly last time until they didn't. Two more hours on email configuration, DNS records, and rate limiting you'll copy-paste from your last project anyway.

Before you know it, a week has passed. You haven't written a single line of code that makes your product unique. You're not building your vision—you're rebuilding the same foundation you've built a dozen times, hoping this time you didn't forget something that'll break in production.

There's a better way to spend your weekend.

## SOLUTION SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Everything you need to ship fast, nothing you don't

**Opening Copy:**
Remarable handles the boring stuff so you can focus on what makes your app different. We're not talking about another collection of unstyled components you have to make work together. This is a complete, production-ready foundation that looks good out of the box and gets better when you make it yours.

**Feature Presentation (written in prose with natural breaks):**

**Authentication that actually works.** Clerk handles OAuth, magic links, and 2FA. User management, session handling, and role-based access control are configured and ready. You write zero auth code, deploy once, and it just works.

**Get paid on day one.** Stripe integration is pre-configured for both one-time payments and subscriptions. Webhook handlers are tested, pricing tables are designed, and the customer portal is ready. Add your API key and start earning.

**A database that scales with you.** Convex gives you real-time updates, serverless functions, and type-safe queries without the complexity. Your data layer is production-ready from the first deploy, and scaling happens automatically as you grow.

**Emails that land in inboxes.** Resend integration comes pre-configured with DMARC and DKIM settings that actually work. Welcome sequences, transactional emails, and notification templates are designed and ready to customize.

**Protected by default.** Arcjet rate limiting and bot protection are built in from day one. Your app can handle traffic spikes and block abuse without you thinking about it.

**Production-grade monitoring.** PostHog analytics, session replays, and error tracking are baked in. You'll know what's working, what's breaking, and how to fix it fast.

**Design that doesn't look like everyone else's.** Built with shadcn/ui, Tailwind 4, and carefully chosen components that work together. Your app will look polished and unique, not like every other indie hacker's MVP. Dark mode, animations, and responsive design are handled.

## THE REMARABLE DIFFERENCE SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Beautiful and fast. You shouldn't have to choose.

**Body Copy:**
Most boilerplates give you components and call it a day. You're left stitching together mismatched pieces, fighting with styling, and hoping it doesn't look like AI generated it.

Remarable is different. Every component is designed to work together. The color system is coherent. The spacing is consistent. The animations are subtle but noticeable. This isn't about giving you a design system—it's about giving you a designed system that you can make your own.

You're not building the next luxury product and wrapping it in fast-food packaging. You're building something that looks as good as it works, and you're doing it in days instead of months.

**Why this matters:** When you ship something that looks good, people take it seriously. They trust it. They buy it. Beautiful design isn't vanity—it's conversion rate optimization built into every pixel.

## WHAT'S INSIDE SECTION

**Section Headline:**
The complete stack for shipping fast

**Opening Line:**
Everything you need to go from idea to revenue, organized by what actually matters to your business.

**Get Started. Get Paid. Get Growing. (Three category headers)**

**Get Started**
User authentication through Clerk with OAuth, magic links, and two-factor authentication. Role-based access control and user management. Onboarding flows that guide new users through setup. Session management that just works across your entire app.

**Get Paid**  
Stripe integration for one-time purchases and subscriptions. Pre-built checkout flows and customer portals. Webhook handlers that update user access automatically. Pricing tables designed to convert. Everything you need to start earning from day one.

Convex database with real-time updates and type-safe queries. Resend email integration with transactional templates. PostHog for analytics, session replays, and feature flags. Arcjet security for rate limiting and bot protection. Background job processing for async workflows. SEO configuration with proper metadata and sitemaps.

**Make It Yours**
600+ shadcn/ui components ready to customize. Tailwind 4 configured with a coherent design system. Dark mode toggle and theme customization. Framer Motion animations. Zod schemas for type-safe forms. Everything documented and ready to extend.

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING SECTION

**Section Headline:**
"Can't I just build this myself?"

**Body Copy:**
Absolutely. And here's what that looks like.

Week one, you're setting up authentication. Reading Clerk docs, configuring OAuth providers, debugging session management, and testing magic link flows. Week two is Stripe. You'll integrate the SDK, set up webhook endpoints, handle subscription edge cases, and probably break something that worked yesterday. Week three is database schema design, real-time subscriptions, and wondering why your queries are slow. Week four, you're still building infrastructure instead of your product.

Or you could use Remarable and ship your first version this weekend.

Your time is worth more than $149. A freelancer would charge $3,000+ just to set this up. The opportunity cost of spending a month on boilerplate while your competitors are shipping features? That's worth even more.

**"What if I want to customize everything?"**

Remarable isn't a black box. It's clean, documented code you own forever. Every component is swappable. Don't like the auth provider? Replace it. Want a different database? Swap it out. Need a custom design system? The foundation is there—make it yours.

This isn't about lock-in. It's about starting with something that works so you can focus on what makes your product different.

**"Is this just another template?"**

Templates give you components. Remarable gives you a working product. The auth flows have been tested with real signups. The payment webhooks work in production. The email templates actually send. The security is configured correctly. This is the foundation I wish I had when I started shipping projects.

You're not getting a collection of files—you're getting battle-tested code that handles the problems you haven't thought about yet.

## FAQ SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Everything else you need to know

**Q: What exactly do I get?**

**A:** You get immediate access to the complete Remarable codebase via GitHub. It's a fully functional Next.js 16 application with authentication, payments, database, email, analytics, and security pre-configured and tested. You also get lifetime updates to the codebase as we add features and update to the latest framework versions. There's detailed documentation for everything, and you can use the code for unlimited projects. This is a one-time purchase with no recurring fees.

**Q: What tech stack does this use?**

**A:** Remarable is built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS 4. For core functionality, we use Clerk for authentication, Stripe for payments, Convex for the database, Resend for email, Arcjet for security, and PostHog for analytics. The UI is built with shadcn/ui components and Framer Motion for animations. Everything is production-ready and documented.

**Q: Can I customize the design and features?**

**A:** Completely. You own the code, and it's designed to be extended and customized. Want to swap out a service? The architecture makes it straightforward. Need a different design? The component system is flexible. Every integration is clearly documented so you understand how it works and can modify it to fit your needs.

**Q: I'm not an expert developer. Can I use this?**

**A:** If you're comfortable with React and Next.js basics, you can use Remarable. The code is clean and well-documented. Each integration has setup guides. That said, this isn't a no-code tool—you'll need development experience to build your product on top of the foundation.

**Q: How do payments and other integrations work?**

**A:** The integrations are pre-configured but use your own accounts. You'll add your Stripe API keys, Clerk credentials, and other service keys to your environment variables. This means you own the relationship with your customers and your data. We just save you the setup time.

**Q: How long does deployment take?**

**A:** Most developers have Remarable deployed to Vercel or Railway in under 30 minutes. That includes creating accounts for the services you need, adding your API keys, and pushing to production. The repository includes deployment guides for the most common hosting platforms.

**Q: What if I find a bug or need help?**

**A:** Remarable is actively maintained. If you find a bug, report it and we'll fix it. Updates are pushed regularly to the repository. For support, there's detailed documentation and setup guides included. Since this is a new product, we're building our community and support systems as we grow.

**Q: Can I get a refund?**

**A:** Since you get instant access to the complete codebase, all sales are final. We're confident Remarable will save you significant time, but make sure you review what's included before purchasing.

**Q: Do I pay for updates?**

**A:** No. Pay once, get lifetime updates. As we add features, improve integrations, and update to new framework versions, you get access to everything automatically through the GitHub repository.
